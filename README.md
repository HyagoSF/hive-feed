# Hive Feed 

https://hive-feed.vercel.app/

Hey, that project I made to learn how to use the last version of Next.js and Typescript, I used some technologies to make it works:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tailwind</strong> to style components</li>
  <li><strong>Prisma ORM</strong> to store the database on cloud for free</li>
  <li><strong>NextAuth</strong> for authentication, using googleProvider, and prismaAdapter to adapt my prisma with my authentication, using <strong>0Auth</strong> from google to add authentication, and get the clientID and clientSecret</li>
  <li> <strong>TanStack Query / react-query v4</strong> - used for data synchronization with database</li>
  <li><strong>react-hot-toast</strong> to show pop ups</li>
  <li> <strong>Framer Motion</strong> react to do animations on react components</li>
</ul>
